    <p>The  imperfection in the world generally is a reflection and a consequence of our  imperfection as mankind. Each one of us keep struggling with habits, behaviours  and attitudes we do not like but exhibit every now and again. We have  weaknesses; tendencies and behaviours with negative impacts and repercussion on  us and our world. Too many times we&rsquo;ve sworn never to act that way again but  before we know it, we&rsquo;re back doing that which we have sworn never to do again.  Even while at it, we know it&rsquo;s wrong but the will power to stop ourselves isn&rsquo;t  always there, we go ahead, do the wrong with our eyes wide open, and after we  are done, we are full of remorse, regret, guilt and at times shame. We say to  ourselves, we would not indulge any longer, we get even religious about it and  ask God to help us, but after a little while, we&rsquo;re back there, doing that  which we do not want to do. This nature is what makes us human; weak, frail,  imperfect and flawed. I do not think there is any human being who gets it right  all the time. We make mistakes every now and again, we act out of character and  misconduct ourselves often.We are ordinary human beings. Incidentally by nature, we,  humans, are the ones in charge of the affairs of this life. Mankind rules the  world. If mankind in our imperfection is in charge of the world then it&rsquo;s no  wonder, disorder, chaos, crisis, errors and mistakes characterise existence. If  the imperfect rules over the perfect, very soon the perfect becomes imperfect.  It&rsquo;s logical. Religion became necessary in order to keep mankind in check, and  help us acknowledge the reality of our accountability to the maker of the world  and the source of life; the Almighty Himself. Through religion, the doctrine of  self-control became prominent and rife. Yes, everyone gets tempted to do wrong  most of the time, but we are supposed to control ourselves and not act based on  how we feel but based on what is appropriate. Doing the right thing.  Righteousness in theme became the order for right morals and right behaviours  for mankind. Ladies and gentlemen, as popular and acceptable as religion is,  wrong behaviours, immorality and decadence has consistently been on the rise  simply because self-control is impossible through a decision or choice; it&rsquo;s a manifestation  initiated from the realm of the supernatural and even this activation takes a  process and a season. <br />
Dear friends, let&rsquo;s face it, we all struggle with  self-control. The things we want to do, we do not do them, those things we do  not want to do are the very things we find ourselves doing most of the time.  Its human nature. In view of this fact dear friends, how then should we conduct  ourselves? You see, I have seen many people go through very difficult  situations, difficult experiences and abject subjugation because they were  simply human; they made mistakes; their weaknesses got the better side of them.  They did what was wrong and their whole world turned against them. Please  understand me, I&rsquo;m not supporting or advocating wrong doing or bad behaviour,  no not at all, my advocacy this morning is for us to be fair, considerate and  careful when criticizing others because we have our weaknesses too, we are also  not perfect. Many times when we sit, and speak and judge and criticise others  who missed it, or made mistakes; we speak with so much effrontery as though we  are flawless, incapable of making mistakes or beyond reproach. When sometimes  in truth, we are weaker or much worse than the victim in our witness box, it&rsquo;s  just that we&rsquo;ve not been discovered yet. When we focus our energies and  attention on the wrong of others and we pride ourselves as professional fault  finders we destroy not just others but ourselves in the process. When we fail  to see the good side in others, the motive behind their desperation, the  experience behind their fears and the upbringing influencing their values  system, but play god over their lives; we destroy potentials, possibilities and  progress for everyone.Getting results does not come by driving others to act  right always. It is a battle you can never win, you cannot make people do what  they are incapable of doing simply because they&rsquo;re incapable by nature. They  lack the will power.<br />
People outgrow  weaknesses over a season through maturity and a mind reset. I&rsquo;ve seen people  who missed death narrowly due to drunk driving yet after their experience,  their drunken nature worsened. They want to stop but lack the self-will to  stop, what they need is help. You don&rsquo;t judge and criticise and disgrace people  out of a wrong conduct or bad behaviour, you love and help people through bad situations  by being caring, sensitive, stern, firm, kind, respectful and truthful. Hate  does not change anybody, it creates in them rebellion and indignation, it is  love that draws people to repentance and inspires the will to change. As a  leader in a home, community, society, business, company or any group, attacking  your family, your followers or subordinates and judging them based on their  weaknesses and bad conduct immediately inspires them to begin to find fault in  you too and guess what, they will find because you&rsquo;re not perfect as well.  Progressive leadership is achieved by identifying with others in both areas of  strength and weaknesses; using the pronoun &lsquo;we &lsquo;and not&lsquo;you'will make them  accept and support you immediately. Coordinating the individual strengths of your  followers and managing their weaknesses is the key to collective success. If  you&rsquo;re distracted by always trying to fix, correct and punish their wrong  doing, you will lose focus and purpose totally and your whole effort will be  centred on the people You most likely would then result to blame game and  finger pointing. You would have allowed the people distract you from the purpose.  Many bosses today suffer stress and high blood pressure trying to fix the  conduct and behaviours of their subordinates, your attention is off the job to  the people; you will not only fail at your job, you will also fail in your  health if you continue to do this. In every team you will find as weaknesses of  members, carelessness, laziness, negligence, apathy, stubbornness, audacious  ignorance, victim mentality and the likes; these are common distractions  everywhere and trying to fight them will eventually wear you out. Focus on  result, inspire your team, encourage them, reward good and outstanding  behaviours, don&rsquo;t celebrate or popularise weaknesses; dwell more and speak more  often on the good and the exceptional; don&rsquo;t spend too much time or give so  much attention to the weaknesses of your team members. What you focus on  becomes bigger. Encourage your team, don&rsquo;t anger them, inspire motivate, be an  example. Do not judge and you will discover you&rsquo;re on the fast lane to uncommon  achievements and great success. Before you control others, learn to control yourself.</p>
